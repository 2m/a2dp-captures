Bluetooth capture and associated Android logs of A2DP negotiation and initial
playback between an HTC Doubleshot (aka myTouch 4G Slide) and an LG HBS-750
headset. Files were captured using instructions found
[here](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/26410/how-do-i-determine-which-a2dp-codecs-my-phone-supports-is-currently-using).

Note that while the HBS-750 offers SBC, mp3 and aptX codecs, the Apollo music
player in the CM10.1 / Android 4.2.2 running on the MT4GS chooses the worst
option, SBC. This is despite the audio files on the phone being encoded as mp3.
